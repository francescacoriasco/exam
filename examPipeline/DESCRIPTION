Description: A set of general-purpose functions implementing an exam pipeline (Steps 3–14)
    for single-cell 10x Genomics data. The workflow includes: (Step 3) selecting scRNA-seq
    10x HDF5 files by content; (Step 4) reproducible subsampling of cells per dataset;
    (Step 5) merging scRNA-seq datasets and exporting a 10x-like sparse MTX bundle;
    (Step 6) extracting ribosomal-protein (RP) gene identifiers from an Ensembl GTF and
    writing an RP-only GTF; (Step 7) filtering the merged expression matrix to RP features;
    (Steps 8–9) Seurat-based dimensionality reduction/clustering and parameter sweeps scored
    by ARI; (Step 10) building RP loci as GRanges from the RP-only GTF; (Steps 11–12) creating
    and merging Signac/Seurat ATAC objects restricted to RP loci and to the same sampled cells;
    and (Steps 13–14) ATAC LSI/UMAP/clustering plus ARI-based parameter sweeps.
